magma environment is set up. We need to see if the magma code runs fine.

So we run `python agents/ui_agent/app.py`

Default: `share=True` is not set in the last line

The error I get is:

```
File "/home/io452/miniconda3/envs/magma/lib/python3.10/site-packages/gradio_client/utils.py", line 863, in get_type
    if "const" in schema:
TypeError: argument of type 'bool' is not iterable

Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/home/io452/Magma/agents/ui_agent/app.py", line 290, in <module>
    demo.queue().launch()
  File "/home/io452/miniconda3/envs/magma/lib/python3.10/site-packages/gradio/blocks.py", line 2465, in launch
    raise ValueError(
ValueError: When localhost is not accessible, a shareable link must be created. Please set share=True or check your proxy settings to allow access to localhost.
```

`share=True` is set in the last line

The previous error from `gradio_client/utils.py` persists however, the other error is gone. The error in `gradio_client` has something to do with jsons if I go with the earlier messages in the stack trace.

The UI is running on: `127.0.0.1:7860`.

But if I Ctrl+click on it, it opens a browser tab that says `Internal Server Error`.

Next, I tried listening to the localhost running on WSL server on the local windows powershell via the command:

`ssh -N -f -L localhost:8000:127.0.0.1:7860 io452@172.30.46.51 `

I tried running `localhost:8000` in one browser tab but it did not work. Here the ip on which the Ubuntu server in WSL is running is `172.30.46.51` and the `gradio_client` UI is running in Ubuntu on the localhost `127.0.0.1:7860`. Also, upon opening the Ubuntu terminal, it clearly says something like `WSL in NAT mode does not support localhost proxies` which means the above approach would never have worked in the current settings of WSL.

I tried some solutions from Google to deal with the WSL CheckConnection error appearing in the WSL window -

1. I disabled the fast power on option in Control Panel
2. I added some extra lines to the .wslconfig file 
3. Then I restarted wsl after running wsl --shutdown in the powershell

None of these helped. The WSL error still persisted. So I reverted back to the original version.

There are two other options for the last line in the `python agents/ui_agent/app.py` file. I ran them and nothing new happened. 

Google search for the error from `gradio_client/utils.py` above takes me to HuggingFace forums and I get the following solutions:

1. [Update gradio](https://huggingface.co/spaces/agents-course/First_agent_template/discussions/251)
2. [Use `pydantic==2.10.6`](https://discuss.huggingface.co/t/gradio-4-26-0-space-no-longer-starts-typeerror-argument-of-type-bool-is-not-iterable-working-in-5-27-0/152654)

Apparently I have a new version of pydantic in the `magma` environment which is: `2.11.4` and the `pydantic-core` is of version `2.33.2`.

Before going ahead with installing new libraries to modify the environment, I first checked in the github issues of `magma`. But I did not find any related issue with `gradio_client`.

I have not gone ahead with these just yet.

`gradio=4.44.1` and `gradio-client=1.3.0` ---> upgrade to ---> `gradio-5.29.0 gradio-client-1.10.0 groovy-0.1.2 safehttpx-0.1.6`
`pydantic=2.11.4` and `pydantic-core=2.33.2` ---> downgrade to ---> `pydantic-2.10.6 pydantic-core-2.27.2`

After making the above changes, I get the following:

```

Could not create share link. Missing file: /home/io452/.cache/huggingface/gradio/frpc/frpc_linux_amd64_v0.3.

Please check your internet connection. This can happen if your antivirus software blocks the download of this file. You can install manually by following these steps:

1. Download this file: https://cdn-media.huggingface.co/frpc-gradio-0.3/frpc_linux_amd64
2. Rename the downloaded file to: frpc_linux_amd64_v0.3
3. Move the file to this location: /home/io452/.cache/huggingface/gradio/frpc
```

and the screen is stuck there. I followed the instructions and ran the code again. The screen is still stuck at this point. I will create the magma environment on server and run the demo to see if this error comes because I think this issue is due to WSL.

I reverted the libraries to their original versions and the code gets stuck at the following error and does not get past it - 

```
File "/home/io452/miniconda3/envs/magma/lib/python3.10/site-packages/gradio_client/utils.py", line 863, in get_type
    if "const" in schema:
TypeError: argument of type 'bool' is not iterable
```

I think that the gradio client is running and it is simply stuck there. There is some internal error and we are not able to get it running on a browser. That's all about it. I need to look further.
